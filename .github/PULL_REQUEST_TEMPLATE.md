#### Purpose (TL;DR) - mandatory

<!--
> give a concise (one or two short sentences) description of what problem is being solved by this PR
>
> Example: Fix issue #123456 by re-structuring the colour selection conditional in method `paintBlue`
-->

<!--
#### Background (Problem in detail)  - optional
-->
<!--
> When relevant, give a more thorough description of what the problem the PR is trying to solve. Examples of good topics for this section are:
> * Link to an existing GitHub issue describing the problem
> * Describing the problem in greater detail than the TL;DR section above
> * How you discovered the issue if it's not already described as an issue on GitHub
> * Discussion of different approaches to solving this problem and why you chose your proposed solution
-->

<!--
#### Solution  - optional
-->
<!--
> When contributing code (and not just fixing typos, documentation and configuration), please describe why/how your solution works. This helps reviewers spot any mistakes in the implementation.
>
> Example:
> "This solution works by adding a `paintBlue()` method"
> Then your reviewer might spot a mistake in the implementation, if `paintBlue()` uses the colour red.
